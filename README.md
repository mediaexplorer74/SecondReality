SecondRealityponyWinRT
======================
Small experiment of running Eric Mooneys remake of Second Reality on Windows Runtime (WinRT).

Uses Monogame (& SharpDX) as graphics backend.

Runs also nicely on 1gen Surface RT tablet, excluding twp scenes, that I didn't have time
to fix.

Should compile nicely with Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8. XNA Content is included
precompiled with project.

Original project is here: https://github.com/erikmooney/SecondRealipony.
