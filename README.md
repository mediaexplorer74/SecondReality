# SecondReality

I started my small experiment of running Eric Mooneys remake of Second Reality (WinRT edition). 

The goal is Desktop-compatible UWP or... W10M-compatible app... who knows :)

## Tech I used
I'll try Uses Monogame (& SharpDX) as graphics backend.

Should compile nicely with Visual Studio 2022 Preview Community for Windows 10/11. 

XNA Content is "included" (precompiled) with project.

## Main changes / Progress (+/-)
- Microsoft.XNA framework -> Monogame XNA framework (?)
- Xna.VideoPlayer -> Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.MediaElement + 
- Monogame XNA Content Pipeline fight (?)
- System.Threading.Thread -> System.Threading.Tasks.Task +

Original project is here: https://github.com/erikmooney/SecondRealipony

## ..
As is. No support. RnD only.
